# Merged Excel Report Generator

This script processes multiple `.xlsx` files in the current directory, extracts data from a specific sheet, and merges them into a single Excel file. The script also replaces specific numerical values with corresponding labels for better readability.

## Project Background
This report was developed based on a client request to identify the beacons located at the FAN Bucharest office, the ones in Bra»ôov, and those currently in transit.
The data used for this report was extracted from multiple Excel files generated by the WIALON platform.

## Features
- Automatically detects and processes all `.xlsx` files in the current directory.
- Extracts data from the `Sensor tracing` sheet.
- Adds a new column with the source file name.
- Reorders columns to make the file name the first column.
- Replaces specific numerical values with predefined labels.
- Saves the merged data into a new Excel file (`merged_file.xlsx`).

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```sh
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

## Usage
1. Place all `.xlsx` files to be merged in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python merge_excel.py
   ```
3. The merged file `merged_file.xlsx` will be created in the same directory.

## Notes
- The script looks for a sheet named `Sensor tracing` in each `.xlsx` file.
- The first column is removed after merging.
- If no `.xlsx` files are found, the script exits with a message.
